# Trawler

An ESP32 based knockoff of the Flipper Zero. (With totally different
functionality). Imagine a broke university student getting inspired by a $170
device and trying to make a $10 version of it.

My plans are to cram as many offensive tools as possible to the chip and then
design a PCB-board for this project. All the components and wiring can be found
in [docs](./docs/COMPONENTS_WIRING.md). ETA 2056.

## Features

For TODOs see [roadmap](./docs/ROADMAP.md).

- WiFi attacks
  - Handshake capture (packet sniffing)
    - Passive listening works in some cases
