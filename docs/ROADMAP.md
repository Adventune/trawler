# Roadmap

Some TODOs on the project. In somewhat prioritized order.

## TODO

- Wifi attacks seem to work only partially, improve that.
  - Document sniffing attack limitations.
  - DOS attack to work.
- Web application logic should be streamlined.
  - Any viewport modifications should be done with templates and htmx.
  - Requests that are made directly to ESP should be cleaned up (don't like the
    XMLHttpRequest API).
  - Improved UX.
- RFID reading, copying and writing.
- Proper API design and documentation..
- Bluetooth attacks (are less useful IMO)?
